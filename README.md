The code presented in this project was edited by me (Cameron Rawlins). Original code was supplied by EdX for this week's challenge. Additional assistance for the code found in this was done by sites such as MDN Web Docs (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) which helped look up some functions of JavaScript.
